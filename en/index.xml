      <title>Creating mTLS reverse proxy with Ktor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you like to integrate with external security systems, then you have probably come across such a thing
as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication#mTLS&#34;&gt;Mutual TLS&lt;/a&gt; (also known as TLS mutual authentication or
mTLS). There is nothing particularly difficult in such integration. Except for two nuances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration will have to be done in each service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In each service you need to put client certificates for passing the mTLS handshake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you can somehow live and put up with the first nuance, then the second already causes much more problems and
leads to sad faces of your security team. To make them happy again, and at the same time eliminate the need to write the
same code in each service, can be made by a smart &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy&#34;&gt;reverse proxy&lt;/a&gt;, which
will take all the hardships and hardships handshake related and possibly some other additional logic. We will do this
farm on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ktor.io/&#34;&gt;Ktor&lt;/a&gt;, because why not;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installing Drozer on macOS Catalina</title>
      <link>https://fi5t.xyz/en/posts/drozer-on-mac/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In general, I don&amp;rsquo;t use Drozer. And using this tool on macOS is unusual for me. If I do some &amp;ldquo;pentest things&amp;rdquo; I just take my Kali Linux with pre-installed Drozer and use it there. But the day has come, and I decided to install Drozer on my macOS. It was a real hell =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time trying to make it work. Eventually, I had to rewrite a piece of class loader script&amp;hellip; A living hell! When everything started working right, I came up with a better way of installing Drozer on macOS and removed all this stuff . In fact, there are two good ways to do it. The Docker-way and the following one&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Elemental Design Patterns (book). My review and notes.</title>
      <link>https://fi5t.xyz/en/posts/elemental-design-patterns-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I read this book and want to share my thoughts about it with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already know about GoF and their Design Patterns then the book will be a godsend for you. The author (and his team) did a great job to spread out GoF&amp;rsquo;s patterns into tiny, elemental patterns and to present the result to us. Why is it significant? It helps to understand the &amp;ldquo;big patterns&amp;rdquo; better and even build your own patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell the truth, the first half of the book seemed to me very boring. A lot of reasoning about &amp;ldquo;the meaning of life&amp;rdquo; and etc. I even wanted to stop reading it. Then I understood what this book is really about and read it from cover to cover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
