      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I read this book and want to share my thoughts about it with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already know about GoF and their Design Patterns then the book will be a godsend for you. The author (and his team) did a great job to spread out GoF&amp;rsquo;s patterns into tiny, elemental patterns and to present the result to us. Why is it significant? It helps to understand the &amp;ldquo;big patterns&amp;rdquo; better and even build your own patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell the truth, the first half of the book seemed to me very boring. A lot of reasoning about &amp;ldquo;the meaning of life&amp;rdquo; and etc. I even wanted to stop reading it. Then I understood what this book is really about and read it from cover to cover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
